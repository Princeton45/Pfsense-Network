# Pfsense-Network
My journey to creating a pfsense enterprise virtual environment.

This projects main purpose was to learn about how to actually configure a router in an enterprise type of setting. I was tired of reading and learning about the fundamental theory about routers and how traffic flows through the network and I wanted to get my hands dirty and configure one for myself. 

My curiosness has led me to understand deeply on how a companys network traffic is routed not just from the internet, but on the intranet too. Even how they work together. This project has been very vital to my self development and career skills. 

Through this project I have gotten familar with Linux, learned and implemented firewall rules, setting up a DMZ, created a Domain Controller on a Linux OS, learned how to setup and configure a router, gained a deeper understanding of TCP/IP and subnets, figuring out how to create LAN interfaces, DHCP, DNS and much more.

My goal for this writeup is to document my journey and hopefully teach others how to setup their own Pfsense network.
